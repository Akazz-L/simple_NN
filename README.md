# simple_NN

This repo is a simple tutorial to understand the main concepts of a neural networks such as forwarding, backpropagation, gradient descent and the role of the learning rate.
The neural network is implemented from scratch using Numpy to better understand how/what is computed behind common frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch ...) to train a neural network on a specific task. Basic maths are also included to describe each step during the training.

For simplicity the task we are focusing on is to map one single input from R^2 to R3.
A colab of the script is provided for demonstration purpose and testing. Please use it to access all the implementation details.
